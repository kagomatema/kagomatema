👋 Hi, I’m Kago Matema, an electronic engineer with a strong focus on IoT, embedded systems, and programming.
👀 I’m interested in Arduino projects, IoT circuit design, embedded programming, network solutions, and system development.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on IoT-based solutions, Arduino development, custom embedded systems, network integration, and creating innovative electronic designs.
📫 How to reach me: You can contact me via my email me at [kagomatema@gmail.com].
⚡ Fun fact: The first computer virus was called "Creeper", It didn’t do any harm – it just displayed the message, “I’m the Creeper, catch me if you can!”
